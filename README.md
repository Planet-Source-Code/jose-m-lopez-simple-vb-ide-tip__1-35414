### Source Code

```
Selecting multiple lines in your code
 and then clicking tab or shift tab
 will tab the selected lines foward
 and backward respectively.
 Most of you probably already know this but
 I did not. Sometimes when my code was
 finished I would later add an extra loop
 to a large procedure requiring reindenting
 line by countless line. I wish I'd known
 I could've done this with one click!
```
